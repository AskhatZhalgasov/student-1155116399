#### Ranking my programming language experience by lines of code:
Rank | Language | Personal Thoughts
--- | --- | ---
1 | `JavaScript` | Kinda hacky but pretty fun. npm is great
2 | `C/C++` | Super powerful, sometimes makes me wanna break my laptop
3 | `Python`| A+. Do all coding interviews/LeetCode in Python. Super fast
4 | `Shell Scripting Languages` | Necessary stuff to know
5 | `Java`  | Too verbose for my liking. Very structured and intuitive though
